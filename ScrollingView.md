# Introduction #

After playing around for a fair while I've been feeling fairly constrained with the area I have to work with.

I like the idea of letting the user build a tower for the peas, as tall as they want.  This could work well with the permanent flag mode, as the user will be able to build up, and possibly re-use the early structures they create.

This will probably take a bit of code re-structuring to achieve with the current implementation, but I think it would be worth it.
