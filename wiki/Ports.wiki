#summary consideration for porting our code to other languages

= Introduction =

python and pygame aren't super portable, and the format strikes me as something that would really lend itself to something like flash, or maybe even the DS.

= Flash =
Action script has all the features of base python, and the player allows you to have art assets addressable and movable in the same way that pygame does it, rotations are also really easy.

The text drawing could be done a little better in the flash player which would probably be easier than porting whatever solution is in pygame.

Pathfinding and physics are completely independent of the graphics, so porting those areas should be the most straightforward of all.

Buttons and UI interactions should be easier to do in flash

= DS =

No idea on what's involved here.  Just a cool idea if anyone wants to play around with it.
