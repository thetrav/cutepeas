#summary Design notes and ideas for polish (gold plating)

= Menu =
It'd be good to have the game start into a screen with a big logo, a few buttons to take the player into a level, and maybe have a small setup for some peas to run around on.

= High score list =
It'd be nice to make high scores fairly visible.  Possibly put them on the menu screen?

= Tutorial / manual =
Even though it's a pretty simple game, a large part of the potential audience would probably benefit from a few tutorial segments, even something as simple as:
  * how to place a block
  * watch a pea climb the block and jump off it
  * watch what happens when a pea jumps too far
  * here's a few different blocks and how they work
The tutorials don't even have to be interactive if we're feeling lazy
