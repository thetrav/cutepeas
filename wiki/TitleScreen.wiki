#summary Design notes on the title screen

= Features =

I'd like to have the title screen contain the following elements:
  * Game name / logo in large letters
  * A HighScore list of at least the top 10 scores
  * A collection of buttons, at least a new game and a quit button, probably a tutorial / help button as well.

To really make the menu screen colorful it would be good to have a very simple pre-built level down the bottom with a pea that constantly jumps of a few blocks onto a spring and then lands on a gel block.
